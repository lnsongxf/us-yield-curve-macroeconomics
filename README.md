# US Treasury yield curve and macroeconomy interaction: evidence from the non-parametric functional lagged regression approach.
Supporting material for the paper: Rubin, T. (2020). "US Treasury yield curve and macroeconomy interaction: evidence from the non-parametric functional lagged regression approach." *arXiv preprint*


A. CONTENTS
-----------

This repository contains the analysis of the US Treasury yield curve dependence on the macroeconomic variables
in the US economy: the annual change in industrial production, the annual inflation, and the federal
funds rate. The methodology follows the novel non-parametric toolbox for spectral analysis of sparsely
observed functional time series. For the details of the methodology and the analysis, see [1]. The code
for this case study is openly available on GitHub [2].

- **master**
This folder includes all the functions used for estimation, prediction, and regression treatments of sparsely observed functional time series.

- **us_macro.m**
Run this script to see the visualisations for the case study results.

- **us_macro.xlsx** and **us_yields.xlsx**
The data for the US treasury yield curve and the macroeconomic variables.
	

B. REQUIREMENTS
---------------

The scripts are written in MATLAB and run/testen in its version R2018a.
The simulation requires the package 'fdaM' (https://www.psych.mcgill.ca/misc/fda/). The packages is included in the master folder.

C. USAGE
